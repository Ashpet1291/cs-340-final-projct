<p>The population of earth is 7.674 billion. Each one of them is part of a family. The
  average family size in the U.S. is 3.15 people. Even if they are a family of 1, families have a lot
  going on, sometimes up to 100’s of individual tasks per person. How do you track everything?
  FamilySpot. It contains an announcement/note section that they can share with other family
  members or keep for themselves. Not realize that we were out of something or something you
  want people to be on the lookout for when they are shopping, add it as item, which other family
  members can see. We have a list that can be customized and shared with family members.
  Can’t remember that great place you want to go to next time you're in the area? Places can help
  you track and plan future trips. Addresses are the physical address of specific places you want
  to save and remember. You can also add as many family members as you need.
